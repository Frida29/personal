Notes: (-26 words)
- I'm a computer science senior undergraduate. I'm planning to go for a PhD in computer science.
- I was in an all girls coding camp right before my junior year in high school that motivated me into going for computer science. I had gained an interest in web development which is what I originally wanted to learn.
- What changed my mind? I came to the realization that computer science was way broader than I had thought. I've learned about software engineering, computer vision, machine learning, and cybersecurity. I've also started doing research under a professor who specializes in data mining with time series data, which is now also my research interest. I feel lucky that I have the opportunity to work under this professor since she is one of the very few female faculty in our department. I look up to her as a role model and mentor.
- I felt like I always knew i would for a STEM field even before I knew I wanted to major in computer science. I had previously considered of just going for math.
- Being a woman in STEM appealed to me because it's new and challenging, yet I saw it as completely doable for me. I believe that field in STEM should definitely be more accessible by providing more opportunities for people to learn about science, coding, math, etc. in an appealing way. Such as the coding camp I went to, I would've have considered computer science if it hadn't been for it.
